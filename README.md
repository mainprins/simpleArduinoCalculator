#Simple Arduino Calculator

This is a simple yet functional Arduino Calculator project capable of performing basic arithmetic operations. It supports Addition and Subtraction, and includes error handling for invalid operations.

The project was prototyped using Wokwi, a browser-based simulator for Arduino, ESP32, and other microcontroller platforms.
🛠️ Features

    Addition (+): Adds two numbers
    Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another
    Error Handling: Displays an error message when an invalid operation is performed
